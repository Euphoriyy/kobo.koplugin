# Device Ready Notifications

## Overview

The "Show device ready notifications" setting controls whether a notification appears when a
Bluetooth input device successfully connects and is ready to use.

## Default Behavior

- **Default**: Enabled
- **Location**: Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Settings → Show device ready notifications

## How It Works

When enabled, you'll see a notification message when:

- A Bluetooth input device connects automatically (via auto-detection or auto-connect)
- You manually connect to a paired device
- A device reconnects after being disconnected

The notification confirms that the device is ready to receive input and can be used immediately.

## When to Disable

You may want to disable this setting if:

- **Frequent reconnections**: You have devices that reconnect often and find the notifications
  distracting
- **Notification noise**: You prefer a quieter experience with fewer on-screen messages
